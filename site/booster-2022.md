### A primer on product discovery

Have you ever wondered how you can figure out which problems to solve for your users first? And why you should pick one problem over another? This is what product discovery is for!

In this talk, I will give a brief introduction into product discovery, introduce a model to help visualise the pieces, and leave attendees with pointers for their own deeper research.

Attendees will get answers to questions such as

- what is discovery as opposed to delivery
- how can it be done in practice
- how does it influence product delivery
- why is it important not to skip it
- how does it relates to company and product strategy


### Product owner is not a job

Every time I see an open position for a Product Owner, I die a little inside. Every time I meet someone who has Product Owner as their job title, I want to give them a hug, and tell them that everything will be okay in the end.

The fact that Product Owner is used as a title shows at best an immature product culture, and at worst a fundamental misunderstanding of modern product development. And it's holding back teams everywhere.

This is an opinion talk, please bring popcorn.
