I am a self-driven and structured team-player who cares deeply about great user experiences. I take a human-centered approach to almost anything, and I can get excited about most things web technology. I am curious and reflective which makes me an exceptional learner.

I have worked on large developer centric web sites and B2B/B2E SaaS products, and I know how to nurture and lead teams and how to build and manage developer communities.

## Work experience

I am good at
- identifying and solving problems for customers and the business, also in a highly-technical context
- making decisions in ambiguous situations and with incomplete data
- shipping products that customers love
- learning about complex topics real fast, and deciding where to dive deeper and where to move on
- leading—and managing—software engineers, remote and in the office
- removing entropy and keeping things on track, oftentimes by doing the work of a missing team member
